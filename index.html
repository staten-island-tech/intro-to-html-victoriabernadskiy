<h3>Victoria Bernadskiy had a doppleganger named Arianna Miller that was born in 1836 and worked as a milk maid. She had a terrible accident in which a cow kicked off her arm, so she was called Armless Ari. When Ari was given off to be married, the husband paid a hefty dowry for her. This included: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cows</li>
        <li>4 goats</li>
        <li>7 chickens</li>
        <li>3 donkeys</li>
        <li>2 pigs</li>
    </ul>
<h4>(This is a very huge dowry. Rumor says that the reason she was worth this much was because she was able to take the milk of the cows that she milked and turn it into Gamer Supps, which didn't exist at the time and was therefore a great commodity. No one knew her secrets, but some speculated that it was because she was a hardcore gamer and would always play marbles with the townspeople.)</h4>

<h3>Victoria Bernadskiy is not a gamer, but she does enjoy one game.</h3>

    <h1>All About ME</h1>
    <h2>This is the story of Victoria Bernadskiy. It has no ending, only a long beginning
     <h3>I have many interests, as most interesting people do</h3>  
     <ol>
      <li>Biking on the boardwalk in the evenings 
        <li>Reading to waste time</li>
        <li>Hiking on trails that pose a threat to my life</li>
        <li>Collecting rocks from the beach and making them into rings</li> 
    <li>Jamming at concerts and festivals (all cool-like)</li> 


</h2> If I were given away as a bride, here is how much money my husbands family would have to pay for me:
<ul>
    <li>Three cows</li>
       <li>Four goats</li>
       <li>Five chickens</li> 
        <li>One rooster</li>

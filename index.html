    <h1>All About ME</h1>
    <h2>The story of Victoria Bernadskiy is thrilling and scary, with a worrying beginning, terrifying middle, and NO
        end. Victoria Bernadskiys story is read to children all around the world, to teach them every moral that any
        bedtime book ever had.
    </h2>

    <h3>Just like all interesting people, Victoria Bernadskiy has extraordinarily interesting hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Biking on the boardwalk during the witching hour</li>
        <li>Hiking on cliffside trails that pose a danger to her life</li>
        <li>Collecting rocks along the beach that match the color of her friends' eyes and turning them into rings</li>
        <li>Reading whatever catches her attention (no mental illness attached)</li>
        <li>Testing different dark chocolate to find the perfect percentage of bitterness (right now it's around a 74%)
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Victoria Bernadskiy had a doppleganger named Arianna Miller that was born in 1836 and worked as a milk maid. She
        had a terrible accident in which a cow kicked off her arm, so she was called Armless Ari. When Ari was given off
        to be married, the husband paid a hefty dowry for her. This included: </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>3 cows</li>
        <li>5 goats</li>
        <li>7 chickens</li>
        <li>3 donkeys</li>
        <li>2 pigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>(This is a very huge dowry. Rumor says that the reason she was worth this much was because she was able to take
        the milk of the cows that she milked and turn it into Gamer Supps, which didn't exist at the time and was
        therefore a great commodity. No one knew her secrets, but some speculated that it was because she was a hardcore
        gamer and would always play marbles with the townspeople.)</h4>

    <h3>Victoria Bernadskiy is not a gamer, but she does enjoy one game.</h3>
